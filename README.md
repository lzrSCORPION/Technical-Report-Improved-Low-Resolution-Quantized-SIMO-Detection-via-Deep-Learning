# Technical-Report-Improved-Low-Resolution-Quantized-SIMO-Detection-via-Deep-Learning
The signal detection problem in a single input
multiple output (SIMO) system with low-resolution analog-todigital
converters (ADCs) is studied. The optimal minimum
mean square error (MMSE) detector is difficult to compute due
to the nonlinearity introduced by ADCs, while linear MMSE
(LMMSE) suffers from performance degradation. Motivated by
the advances in deep learning, a convolutional neural network
detector (CNND) is proposed, leveraging the highly successful
TextCNN. Numerical results suggest that the performance of
CNND outperforms LMMSE in the majority of the cases, and
has less runtime. We also show that the CNND is robust to the
inaccurate channel coefficients.
